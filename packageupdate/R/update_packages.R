# Some simple functions to help transfer packages between R installations.
#
# This will run in whatever the current working directory is, so if you want
# to save the package information somewhere specific, then setwd() to that place.
#
# To save a list of currently installed packages, run:
#       save_package_info()
# 
# This will create a file called current_packages.rda by default (which you can overide
# if you want)
# 
# To see differences between a previous package configuration and the currently installed
# packages, run:
#       package_difference()
# This will read a file from disk with the previous packages on (again the default is 
# current_packages.rda, but you can specifiy another) and return a list of differences
#
# To reload the packages from a previous saved list, run:
#       reload_packages()
# specifying a filename where the previous package list can be found if it's not the 
# default.
#
# The script will try CRAN first and then if there are any packages it couldn't load
# it will try bioconductor.
#
# A typical use case:
#    If you install a new version of R, say 3.2.4 and you were previously running
#    R version 3.2.3, then the new version won't contain the packages you were using
#    before.
#    
#    The following steps will get you up to date:
#               1.  Start previous version of R
#               2.  Set working directory to where this script is
#               3.  Source the script
#               4.  Run save_package_info()
#               5.  Start the new version of R
#               6.  Set working directory to where this script is and source the script
#               7.  Run reload_packages
